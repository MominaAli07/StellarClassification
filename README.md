# StellarClassification
The scientific study of celestial objects, phenomena, and the universe is known as astronomy. The exploration of the universe's origins and evolution, as well as the observation and study of stars, planets, moons, galaxies, and other celestial phenomena, are just a few of the many themes covered in this area.
Improving our knowledge of the properties and cosmic distribution of celestial objects is the main objective of this study. Our goal is to use data mining techniques to categorize stars, galaxies, and quasars according to their spectral features.
We used a variety of classification methods on the dataset, evaluating each one's accuracy-based performance.
We obtained the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) dataset from Kaggle for this research. Each of the 100,000 observations in the dataset has 17 characteristics. Three distinct object kinds are included in the target feature, class:
Galaxy Quasar (QSO) Star
